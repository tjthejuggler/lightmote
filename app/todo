audio stuff
figure out how to make different notes be different color

maybe shrink mic buttons
    longhold it to change the threshold (duration, loudness, space between)
        make a 'return to default' option
    eventually in longhold menu make a toggle between simple and complex audio control

make a loop button like the mic button

instead of just colors, make the squares represent loops
    by default the loops are just of single colors, so they are as things are now
    if only one loop is on for a ball, show its loop out on main screen?


make a settings button to input the IP of the balls for each row
    or make a button on each row that opens an input for putting in the IP
    would probably be good to have settings for other stuff though
a way to power off the balls
a way to save button colors
a way to return to default colors

determine if it is better to use their built in sequence system or make my own
a way to record sequences
a way to play an mp3 that starts at the same time as recorded sequences
a way to load/save sequences

misc thoughts
what else would be good for audience participation?
